# WildfireSpreadTS Dataset - Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the WildfireSpreadTS dataset, a multi-modal time series dataset designed for wildfire spread prediction research. The analysis covers data quality assessment, statistical characterization, spatiotemporal patterns, feature relationships, and preprocessing recommendations.

## Dataset Overview

- **Temporal Coverage**: 2018-2021
- **Spatial Resolution**: 375m per pixel
- **Features**: 23 channels representing environmental variables
- **Target Variable**: Active fire confidence levels (Channel 22)

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Quality Assessment

- Total samples analyzed: 7,168,781
- Number of features: 23
- Fire events covered: 40
- Years included: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021
- Dataset size: 629.0 MB

#### Missing Values
- 2 channels have >10% missing values
- Channels requiring attention: Ch3, Ch4

### 2. Target Variable Characteristics
- Fire confidence mean: 0.0239
- Fire confidence std: 0.6351
- Fire confidence range: [0.00, 22.00]

### 3. Feature Relationships
- 0 strong correlations (|r| > 0.7) identified
- Potential multicollinearity issues detected

### 4. Preprocessing Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following preprocessing steps are recommended:

1. **Missing Value Treatment**: Apply appropriate imputation strategies for channels with significant missing data
2. **Normalization**: Use channel-specific normalization methods based on data distribution characteristics
3. **Feature Engineering**: Consider creating derived features from environmental variable combinations
4. **Class Imbalance**: Implement sampling strategies or specialized loss functions for fire detection

### 5. Modeling Implications

The analysis reveals several important considerations for model development:

- **Extreme Class Imbalance**: Fire events are rare, requiring specialized handling techniques
- **Multi-scale Patterns**: Features exhibit both local and global spatial patterns
- **Temporal Dependencies**: Clear temporal evolution in fire behavior and environmental conditions
- **Feature Interactions**: Strong relationships between meteorological variables suggest potential for ensemble methods

## Conclusion

The WildfireSpreadTS dataset presents both opportunities and challenges for wildfire spread prediction modeling. The comprehensive environmental feature set provides rich information for model training, while the extreme class imbalance and missing value patterns require careful preprocessing attention.
